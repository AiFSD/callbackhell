**Independence Day Countdown**

A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that counts down from 10 to 0 and then displays a festive message and background image for Independence Day.

**Description
This project is a fun way to celebrate Independence Day with a countdown timer that updates every second. When the countdown reaches 0, a festive message and background image are displayed.


**Features**

* Countdown timer that updates every second
* Festive message and background image display when the countdown reaches 0
.
  **How it works:**

1. The HTML file creates a basic webpage with a `<div>` element to display the countdown.
2. The JavaScript file sets a countdown variable to 10 and uses a self-invoking function to decrement the count every second using `setTimeout`.
3. When the count reaches 0, the JavaScript file updates the HTML content to display a festive message and adds a CSS class to change the background image.
4. The CSS file styles the webpage with a basic layout and font settings, and defines a `.bg` class to display the background image.

**Files:**

* `index.html`: The main HTML file
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the countdown and updates the HTML content
* `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the webpage
